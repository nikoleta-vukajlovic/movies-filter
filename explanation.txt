To begin with, the function for parsing command line arguments was implemented.
It checks if at least one movie title has been passed, then it returns all titles and
genre and IMDb rating if they have been passed.

Then, in the main function, first it connects to the database. I used mongoDB, and created
"movie" collection in which I stored downloaded movie information.
Then, for all movie titles I checked if it is already stored in the database. If it is not stored, I send
requests to OMDb API, if it is stored, I get the information from the database.

Then, I checked which parameter is passed and wrote movie information if the specified movie
satisfies the conditions.
